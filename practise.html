          We had featured Lionel Messi in our articles about Celebrities that
          Help the Poor with Humanitarian, Volunteer and Charity Works and
          Football Players into Volunteer and Charity works.By that time he was
          portrayed only as a celebrity or as a footballer helping the people in
          different parts of the globe. But today, Messi has become more than a
          player, he has become a symbol, a symbol of hope that with dedication
          and commitment we can achieve what we want.

          In Argentina four million people filled the streets to celebrate the
          victory of the team. This is a historic display of unity and
          togetherness. Football has only become a medium here, however this
          event is a perfect example of how feeling winning a value and being
          respected can enthrall the human emotions .Right after Argentinaâ€™s
          national soccer team touched down in Buenos Aires after victory of the
          World Cup, people overflowed in the streets and displayed the
          appreciation and sentimental responses that the world has never seen
          before.

            <h4 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 20px;">Remembering Messi's Charity Works</h4>
            We want to recognize once again how Messi has been  engaged in numerous 
            welfare activities affiliated with children's health through his 
            "The Leo Messi Foundation". Apart from his successful career on the field, 
            how he is also known for his charitable work and efforts to help people in need, 
            that is also commendable.Apart from his foundation Messi has  made personal donations 
            to various social causes and has participated in philanthropic events to support people in need. 
            We all remember Messi has donated around one million euro for the clinical and healthcare 
            support in his home country Argentina During COVID pandemic.Not only us, the whole world will 
            always remember if someone gives back to the planet and its people after reaching a 
            certain point of success in life, like Messi did.
